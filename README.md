Loop Cinemas

Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was expected that many businesses and some industries would cease to exist after a
few years of being closed. One such industry was the film and cinema industry. Fortunately, going to see a movie in
person has continued to exist, with some films continuing to break box office records. With the ever-growing adoption
of streaming platforms such as Netflix, cinema operators are looking at ways to improve the way that they engage with
their customers and use technology online.
Loop Cinemas is a long running cinema operator with several cinema locations around Australia. They focus on a
premium, unique experience and bringing community into their cinema experiences. In addition to displaying the latest
and greatest films, Loop also holds a few community events, art shows and the like at their locations.
One challenge Loop Cinemas is facing is that whilst they do a very good job delivering a great cinema experience, they
have not kept up with the times and have very little technology and online capabilities as part of their business.
Their competitors have features like online booking, film ratings, reviews, and search. Loop Cinemas do not have these
features and as a result they are being left behind, with customers preferring to go to other cinemas because they provide
a better user experience prior to arriving in the cinema.
For all the above reasons, you have been approached by a senior representative of Loop Cinemas who have secured
funding to build a new website experience for their business. The project has been codenamed “Loop Web”.
At this stage, Loop Web will help potential customers discover upcoming films, session times and see ratings and
reviews from other moviegoers.

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
